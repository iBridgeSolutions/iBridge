# Microsoft 365 Mirror Portal: Complete Implementation Guide

This document explains how the Microsoft 365 Mirror Portal has been configured to provide exclusive access to **lwandile.gasela@ibridge.co.za (IBDG054)** with complete mirroring of all Microsoft 365, Azure AD, Entra ID, and Microsoft Admin Center features.

## 1. Overview

The Microsoft 365 Mirror Portal is a comprehensive solution that replicates the functionality, data, and user experience of:
- Microsoft 365 Admin Center
- Azure Active Directory Portal / Entra ID
- Exchange Admin Center
- SharePoint Admin Center
- Teams Admin Center
- Security and Compliance Centers

The portal is designed to mirror all Microsoft features while maintaining exclusive access control for a single administrator (lwandile.gasela@ibridge.co.za).

## 2. Authentication Methods

The portal supports two authentication methods, both restricted to a single user:

### 2.1 Microsoft 365 Authentication
- Allows login via Microsoft 365 account (lwandile.gasela@ibridge.co.za)
- Uses Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for secure OAuth authentication
- Restricts access to only the specified admin account

### 2.2 Employee Code Authentication
- Allows login using employee code IBDG054
- Provides an alternative authentication method if Microsoft authentication is unavailable
- Same access level and permissions as Microsoft 365 login

## 4. Data Extraction & Mirroring

The portal uses a comprehensive data extraction process to mirror all Microsoft 365 data:

### 4.1 Data Sources
- Microsoft Graph API
- Azure AD PowerShell
- MSOnline PowerShell
- Exchange Online PowerShell
- SharePoint Online PowerShell
- Teams PowerShell

### 4.2 Data Storage
- All data is stored in structured JSON files
- User profiles and photos are cached locally
- Security information is properly stored and protected
- Regular extraction updates the mirrored data

## 5. Access Control & Security

### 5.1 Exclusive Access Configuration
- Access is restricted to only lwandile.gasela@ibridge.co.za
- Employee code IBDG054 is mapped to this account only
- All authentication attempts from other accounts are blocked
- Access control is enforced at both application and data levels

### 5.2 Security Features
- Token validation for Microsoft authentication
- Session management and timeout
- Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- HTTPS for all communications
- No direct write access to Microsoft services from the portal (read-only mirror)

## 6. Technical Implementation

### 6.1 Configuration Files
- `intranet/data/access-control.json` - Controls exclusive access settings
- `intranet/data/employee-codes.json` - Maps employee code to email
- `intranet/data/settings.json` - Portal configuration and features
- `intranet/data/mirror-configuration.json` - Mirror settings and capabilities

### 6.2 Authentication Flow
1. User attempts login via Microsoft 365 or employee code
2. Authentication module validates credentials
3. Access control check confirms user is authorized
4. Session is established with appropriate permissions
5. User is granted access to the mirrored portal

### 6.3 Data Extraction Process
1. Script connects to all Microsoft services using admin credentials
2. Comprehensive data is extracted from all services
3. Data is processed and structured for the portal
4. User interface displays the mirrored data

## 7. Getting Started

### 7.1 Initial Setup
1. Run `CONFIGURE-EXCLUSIVE-ACCESS.bat` to set exclusive access for lwandile.gasela@ibridge.co.za
2. Run `EXTRACT-COMPLETE-M365-MIRROR.bat` to extract all Microsoft data
3. Start the unified server with `CHECK-AND-START-UNIFIED-SERVER.bat`
4. Access the portal at http://localhost:8090/intranet/

### 7.2 Login Methods
- Use Microsoft 365 authentication with your admin account
- Alternatively, use employee code IBDG054

### 7.3 Refreshing Data
- Run `EXTRACT-COMPLETE-M365-MIRROR.bat` periodically to refresh the mirrored data
- The portal will automatically use the updated data

## 8. Support & Maintenance

### 8.1 Troubleshooting
- Check server logs for any authentication issues
- Verify access control settings if experiencing login problems
- Ensure all required PowerShell modules are installed for data extraction

### 8.2 Updating the Mirror
- Run the extraction script to get the latest data
- No additional configuration is needed after initial setup
