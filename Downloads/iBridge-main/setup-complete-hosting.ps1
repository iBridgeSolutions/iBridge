# AWS Deployment Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Install AWS CLI: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
2. Configure AWS credentials: Run `aws configure`

## S3 Bucket Setup
1. Create an S3 bucket for your website:
   ```
   aws s3 mb s3://$domainName --region us-east-1
   ```

2. Enable website hosting on the bucket:
   ```
   aws s3 website s3://$domainName --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
   ```

3. Upload your website files:
   ```
   aws s3 sync . s3://$domainName --exclude "*.ps1" --exclude "*.md" --exclude ".git/*"
   ```

## CloudFront Setup
1. Request an SSL certificate in ACM:
   ```
   aws acm request-certificate --domain-name $domainName --validation-method DNS --subject-alternative-names www.$domainName
   ```

2. Create a CloudFront distribution pointing to your S3 bucket
3. Update your DNS settings to point to the CloudFront distribution
