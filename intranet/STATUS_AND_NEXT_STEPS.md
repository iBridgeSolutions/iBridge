  - Confirm client ID (2f833c55-f976-4d6c-ad96-fa357119f0ee) is active
  - Verify tenant ID (feeb9a78-4032-4b89-ae79-2100a5dc16a8) is correct
  - Configure redirect URIs in Azure portal to match your production domains
  - Check "Access tokens" and "ID tokens" under Implicit grant in Azure
- Follow the detailed Azure AD setup checklist in `AZURE_AUTH_CHECKLIST.md`

- Configure proper server settings
- Use `auth-fixer-azure.html` for troubleshooting Azure AD integration issues

### 4. Content Population

## Technical Notes

The intranet portal is built using:

- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5.3.2 for responsive design
- Font Awesome 6.4.0 for icons
- Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Microsoft 365 authentication
- Local storage and session storage for data persistence

## Azure AD Integration

The intranet portal has been configured to work with Azure AD for Microsoft 365 authentication. To complete the setup:

1. **Azure AD Configuration**
   - Use the `AZURE_AUTH_CHECKLIST.md` guide to verify your Azure AD setup
   - Make sure the correct redirect URIs are registered in Azure
   - Test the authentication flow using the `auth-fixer-azure.html` tool

2. **Diagnostic Tools Available**
   - `auth-fixer-azure.html` - Azure AD specific authentication debugging
   - `session-debug.html` - General session debugging
   - `diagnose-auth.ps1` - PowerShell script to check configuration
   - `redirect-test.html` - Test redirect handling
   - `path-test.html` - Test URL path handling

Remember that Azure AD changes can take up to 15 minutes to propagate, so allow some time after making changes in the Azure portal before testing.

The codebase is organized into:

- HTML pages for each section
- Reusable partials (header, footer)
- Modular stylesheets for different components
- Central JavaScript file with page-specific functions

## Testing the Portal

To run the intranet portal locally:

1. Ensure Node.js is installed
2. Navigate to the intranet folder
3. Run `.\serve-intranet.ps1`
4. Access the portal at `http://localhost:8090/login.html`
5. Use the development login option with the following credentials:
   - Name: Any name
   - Email: `any.name@ibridge.co.za` (must end with `@ibridge.co.za`)
   - Admin: Check for admin access, uncheck for standard user access
