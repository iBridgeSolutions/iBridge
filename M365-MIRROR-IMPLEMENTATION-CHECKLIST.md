## Notes

This checklist covers the complete implementation of the iBridge Intranet Portal with enhanced security features. Items marked as incomplete need to be implemented to complete the project.

The portal is configured for exclusive use by the designated administrator (IBDG054) and includes advanced security measures including password hashing, two-factor authentication, rate limiting, and CSRF protection.
