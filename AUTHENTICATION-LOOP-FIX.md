# Authentication Loop Fix

This document explains how the authentication refresh loop issue was fixed in the custom authentication system.

## Problem

When logging in with the employee code IBDG054, the portal would refresh constantly causing a glitch screen. This was due to a mismatch between how the old and new authentication systems store and check for user data.

## Solution

The fix involved the following changes:

1. Updated `intranet.js` to check for both old (`user`) and new (`portalUser`) authentication formats
2. Modified the `loadUserInfo` function to handle both authentication formats
3. Added cookie management to ensure compatibility between systems
4. Updated the custom authenticator to set both authentication formats
5. Enhanced login handlers to immediately set cookies and session variables

## How It Works

The authentication system now:

- Checks for both old and new authentication formats
- Stores user data in both formats for backward compatibility
- Sets consistent cookies for all login methods
- Handles employee code (IBDG054) login properly
- Provides a smooth transition between pages

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Run `FIX-AUTHENTICATION-LOOP.bat`
2. Start the server with `CHECK-AND-START-UNIFIED-SERVER.bat`
3. Navigate to [http://localhost:8090/intranet/](http://localhost:8090/intranet/)
4. Login with the employee code IBDG054
5. Verify you can navigate the portal without refresh loops

## Default Login Credentials

- **Employee Code**: IBDG054
- **Username**: <lwandile.gasela@ibridge.co.za>
- **Password**: iBridge2025 (or ibridge123)

## Note

This fix ensures compatibility between the old Microsoft 365 authentication system and the new custom authentication system using the IBD format employee codes.
